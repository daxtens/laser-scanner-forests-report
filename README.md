Real-time Laser Odometry for Hexacopters in Forests
==================================

Or more verbosely: "Investigating the feasibility of laser scanners for autonomous navigation of hexacopters in forests"

You want `u5376292_Daniel_Axtens_Real-time_Laser_Odometry.pdf`.

If you want code, you want my [`various_ros_packages`](https://github.com/daxtens/various_ros_packages) and [`scan_tools`](https://github.com/daxtens/scan_tools) repositories. They will eventually be centralised here.

If anything is missing, please get in touch!
